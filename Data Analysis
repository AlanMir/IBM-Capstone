Analysing data
Step 1: looking for direct competence.
Since Los Mochis is a coastal city, we expect the competence to be high, but rewards can also be high given the popularity of seafood
cuisine.As we can see, ther is a high number of seafood restaurants in Los Mochis, so we should be careful in selecting an appropriate
location.

Step 2: looking for popular places
We find that there are only one baseball field and one coccer field, but also there are six malls. As we know, the stakeholders want
their business to be visible for possible customers, and a way to get this is finding a popular place, like malls or sport fields,
and locate the restaurant near of one of them.

Step 3: selecting a place
By looking the distribution of seafood restaurants and popular spots in Los Mochis, we can see a promising place locaten in the middle
of three highly popular places, and where there is only one seafood restaurant. The place is located in the middle of Emilio Ibarra
Baseball Stadium, Plaza Sendero and Plaza Las Fuentes. In this place we only find one seafood restaurant, called "Mariscos Las Ca√±as 2".
